This is a small modified version of popular online game [Fruit Box](https://en.gamesaien.com/game/fruit_box/), using only the numbers 1, 2, 3.

This idea was inspired by good friend of mine @cytusine0. 

For now the game only runs through downloading and running the Python files locally, planning on making a webpage for the game to run on.
